# Python OOP Assignments

This repository contains assignments on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.

## Assignments

### 1. Class Design Assignment 
- Created a class (`Smartphone`) with attributes and methods.
- Implemented inheritance using a subclass (`GamingSmartphone`).
- Demonstrated encapsulation with private attributes and getters/setters.

### 2. Polymorphism Challenge
- Created different classes (`Car`, `Plane`, `Boat`) that implement a `move()` method differently.
- Demonstrated polymorphism by iterating over different objects and calling their `move()` method.
